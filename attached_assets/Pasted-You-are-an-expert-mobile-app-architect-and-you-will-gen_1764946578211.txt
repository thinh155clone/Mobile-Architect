You are an expert mobile app architect and you will generate a complete mobile app called "Social Media Exposure Analyzer".

The app must be fully working from A–Z and include all screens, UI layout, data flow, and backend logic using AppyPie mobile app builder.

=====================
APP PURPOSE
=====================
This app analyzes public information from social media profiles to detect privacy leaks.

User inputs:
- Facebook profile link
- Instagram profile link
- TikTok profile link

App features:
1. Public Information Scanner
2. Exposure Analyzer
3. Risk Score Calculator
4. Privacy Recommendations
5. History of previous analyses

=====================
FEATURE DETAILS
=====================

1. Public Information Scanner:
- Extract public data from the given URL.
- Collect: username, bio, email, phone number (if visible as text), follower count, images (thumbnails), captions.
- For images: app only processes text and metadata.

2. Exposure Analyzer:
- OCR on images to detect: phone numbers, emails, addresses, license plates.
- Detect sensitive words from captions: "CCCD", "passport", "address", "home", "school".
- Count number of faces in each image using lightweight on-device detection (or simulated detection).
- Extract EXIF metadata (GPS if available).

3. Risk Score Calculation:
Score = Identity Exposure + Contact Exposure + Location Exposure + Visual Sensitive Exposure.
Ranges:
- 0–20 Low
- 21–50 Medium
- 51–75 High
- 76–100 Critical

4. Privacy Recommendations:
Based on findings, show:
- "Remove phone number from bio"
- "Avoid showing ID card"
- "Turn off location in photos"
- "Set account to private"
- "Hide posts containing sensitive information"

5. Full UI screens:
- Home screen (Input URL)
- Analyze result screen
- Risk Score gauge screen
- Sensitive image findings
- EXIF data findings
- Privacy tips screen
- App settings
- History of scans

6. Export report:
- Generate downloadable PDF summary of findings.

=====================
APP REQUIREMENTS
=====================
- Auto-generate UI with clean layout.
- Auto-generate data fields.
- Use no paid API.
- Use only public-web scraping through AppyPie workflow.
- Simulate image analyzer using text-based OCR extraction.
- Must run fully local inside AppyPie builder.

=====================
DELIVERABLES
=====================
Generate:
- Full app structure
- All screens
- All navigation
- All data tables
- All workflows
- All logic rules
- Fake API connectors if needed
- UI components
- Buttons, forms, lists, images, score meter

=====================
IMPORTANT
=====================
Do NOT ask additional questions.  
Do NOT simplify the app.  
Generate everything automatically.

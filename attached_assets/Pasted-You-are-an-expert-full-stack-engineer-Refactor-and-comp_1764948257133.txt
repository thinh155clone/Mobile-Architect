You are an expert full-stack engineer.  
Refactor and complete my Social Media Exposure Analyzer application according to the following full “Hướng 1” requirements.  
Do NOT ask questions, just perform all changes automatically and update all frontend + backend code.

========================
GOAL
========================
Transform this project into a polished, fully working full-stack application with:
- Clean backend architecture
- Stable API endpoints
- Real data persistence (JSON storage)
- Improved risk scoring engine
- Improved findings extraction
- PDF report generation
- Clean and organized frontend integration

========================
BACKEND TASKS
========================
1. Re-organize backend folder structure:

backend/
   server.js
   routes/
      analysisRoutes.js
      historyRoutes.js
      reportRoutes.js
   services/
      analysisService.js
      riskEngine.js
      dataService.js
      reportService.js
   data/
      history.json
   utils/
      pdfTemplate.js

2. Improve API endpoints:

POST /api/analyze  
Return:  
{
   riskScore,
   leaks,
   findings: {
       phones,
       emails,
       faces,
       gps
   },
   recommendations
}

GET /api/history  
Return all saved history.

GET /api/report/:id  
Generate a clean PDF report using a styled template.

3. Implement improved Risk Score Engine:
- phones.length * 15
- emails.length * 15
- faces * 5
- gps ? +25 : +0
- cap at 100

4. Improve findings extraction:
- Phone detection RegExp: /(0|\\+84)[0-9]{8,10}/g
- Email RegExp
- Simulated face count (0–4)
- Simulated GPS leak (null or random city)

5. Improve recommendations:
Generate suggestions based on findings.

6. Clean and optimize server.js:
- Use correct Express routing
- Enable CORS
- Add appropriate error handling
- Ensure JSON body parsing
- Ensure backend is compatible with Replit hosting

========================
FRONTEND TASKS
========================
1. Replace all mock data with real API calls to backend.
2. Ensure the following pages work correctly:
   - Overview
   - Findings
   - Actions
   - History (load from database)
   - PDF report download
3. Improve UI:
   - Clean cards
   - Better labels for leaks
   - Better risk score display
4. Remove unused mock logic files.

========================
GENERAL TASKS
========================
- Clean unused files
- Improve folder organization
- Make sure everything builds and runs correctly
- Provide a short summary of changes after completing

========================
IMPORTANT RULES
========================
- Do NOT ask follow-up questions
- Modify any file necessary
- Implement everything automatically
- Make the app fully functional and stable
